Customer churn, defined as customers stopping doing business or ending their relationship with a company, is a major problem facing companies across industries (Ahn et al., 2020). In the travel and tourism sector, customer churn can have dire financial implications for tour and travel companies. When customers churn, companies lose out on potential revenue from those customers in the future. Additionally, acquiring new customers often requires substantial investments in sales, marketing, and promotions - investments that provide no return if those customers quickly churn. Therefore, curbing customer churn is imperative for travel companies to reduce revenue leakage and maximize growth.
An effective customer churn prediction model powered by AI can deliver tremendous business value. It has been estimated that reducing customer churn rates by just 5% could increase company profits by 25% to 125% (Isson, 2018). For the tour and travel company, this translates to millions in recovered lost revenue annually. Additionally, by retaining more customers longer, it helps create a stable base of brand advocates who can drive referrals and positive word-of-mouth. The positive reputation also serves to lower future customer acquisition costs (Kumar & Reinartz, 2016). With the substantial monetary savings and growth acceleration enabled by the churn prediction model, it is undoubtedly a high-ROI project with the potential to provide a significant competitive edge.
The goal of this project is to build an AI-based predictive model that can identify customers at high risk of churning, allowing the tour and travel company to take proactive measures to retain them. Specifically, it will leverage a supervised deep learning algorithm to predict customer churn based on various indicators present in the customer dataset provided. Deep learning refers to a subset of machine learning algorithms that make use of neural networks to model complex patterns in data. Compared to other machine learning approaches, deep learning models are highly adept at automatically identifying complex nonlinear feature interactions within data that have high predictive power.
The key approach will be to feed a deep neural network model with a dataset of existing customer attributes and transactions, including their final churn status. The predictive patterns discovered by the deep learning model can then be used to classify new customers as high or low propensity to churn. Some potential customer attributes that could serve as predictor variables include demographics, booking details, customer lifetime value, satisfaction scores, and activity metrics. By deploying the model to score new customers in real-time, high churn risk customers can be flagged early on. The sales and marketing teams can then develop targeted retention campaigns, customized incentives, and service improvements for these customers proactively, rather than reacting post-facto after they have already churned.
The remainder of this report will elaborate on the project in detail, covering - the business objectives and plan, dataset exploration and preparation, deep learning model development, model evaluation, and final deployment and integration within the companyâ€™s existing IT infrastructure.
